<h1>Introduction</h1>
This Readme is for the "Expression Generator" project, a web-based tool that helps users find mathematical expressions from a list of numbers that equal a target value, built using Streamlit. It includes step-by-step instructions to set up and use the application, along with examples and testing guidelines.

<h1>Installation and Setup</h1>
<h3>To get started, follow these steps:</h3>

Ensure Python is installed: Download and install Python from python.org if you don't have it already.
Install Streamlit: Open your terminal and run pip install streamlit.
Clone the repository: Use Git to clone this repository:
```
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/expression-generator
```
Replace yourusername with the actual GitHub username.
Navigate to the directory: Go to the cloned repository directory:
```
cd expression-generator
```

Run the application: Start the Streamlit application:
```
streamlit run Streamlit.py
```

Open the local URL provided in your browser to access the application.

<h1>Usage and Examples</h1>
<h2>The application has a simple interface:</h2>

Enter comma-separated numbers (e.g., "1,2,3") in the text input field.
Enter the target value as an integer (e.g., 6) in the number input field.
Click "Find Expression" to see the result, which will show the first expression that equals the target, like "(2 * 3) = 6", or "No solution found" if none exists.

<h3>Here are some examples:</h3>

| Numbers    | Target | Expected Output           |
|------------|--------|---------------------------|
| 1,2,3      | 6      | (2 * 3) = 6               |
| 1,2,3      | 10     | No solution found.        |
| 5          | 5      | 5 = 5                     |
| 1,-1       | 0      | (1 + (-1)) = 0            |

Note: The application displays the first expression it finds that equals the target. There might be multiple expressions that work, but it only shows one.

<h1>Algorithm Overview</h1>
The program uses a recursive method to generate all possible mathematical expressions using addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/), ensuring division results are integers and avoiding division by zero. It checks all subsets and permutations of the numbers to find the first match, which might be slow for large lists due to the many possibilities.

<h1>Testing</h1>
<h3>To test the application, try these inputs:</h3>

Numbers "1,2,3", Target 6 → Should display an expression like "(2 * 3) = 6".
Numbers "1,2,3", Target 10 → Should display "No solution found."
Numbers "5", Target 5 → Should display "5 = 5".
Numbers "1,-1", Target 0 → Should display "(1 + (-1)) = 0".
Numbers "1,two,3", Target any → Should display "Invalid input. Please enter valid numbers and target."
